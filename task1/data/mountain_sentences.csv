Everest,Mount Everest (known locally as Sagarm th in Nepal and Qomolangma in Tibet) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level.
Everest,"Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers."
Everest,"While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall."
Everest,"As of May 2024, 340 people have died on Everest."
Everest,"Climbers typically ascend only part of Mount Everest's elevation, as the mountain's full elevation is measured from the geoid, which approximates sea level."
Everest,"The closest sea to Mount Everest's summit is the Bay of Bengal, almost 700 km (430 mi) away."
Everest,"To approximate a climb of the entire height of Mount Everest, one would need to start from this coastline, a feat accomplished by Tim Macartney-Snape's team in 1990."
Everest,The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers.
Everest,"Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the Southeast Ridge route."
Everest,"Mount Everest's Nepali Sanskrit name is Sagarm th (IAST transcription) or Sagar-Matha ( - , s rmat a , lit."
Everest,"The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma ( , lit."
Everest,"Waugh argued that because there were many local names it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he therefore decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India."
Everest,"Everest himself opposed the honour, and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that ""Everest"" could neither be written in Hindi nor pronounced by ""the native of India""."
Everest,"Despite Everest's objections, Waugh's proposed name prevailed, and the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted the name ""Mount Everest"" in 1865."
Everest,The modern pronunciation of Everest () is different from Sir George's pronunciation of his surname ( EEV-rist).
Everest,"In the late 19th century, many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar, a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest."
Everest,"In 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements."
Everest,"Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being ""the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest""."
Everest,"In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey."
Everest,"From 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft)."
Everest,"In May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock."
Everest,"In 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse."
Everest,"In the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography."
Everest,"On 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of 0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date."
Everest,"In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m."
Everest,The summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level.
Everest,"By the same measure of base to summit, Denali (also called Mount McKinley) in Alaska is taller than Everest as well."
Everest,"By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m (13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to 15,260 ft)."
Everest,"The summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2,168 m (7,113 ft) farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi) than that of Everest (6,382.3 km, 3,965.8 mi), because the Earth bulges at the equator."
Everest,"This is despite Chimborazo having a peak of 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft)."
Everest,"Many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest, for example Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) and Khumbutse, 6,636 m (21,772 ft)."
Everest,Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations.
Everest,"From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation."
Everest,"A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is 60 m (200 ft) thick comprises the foot of the ""Third Step"", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest."
Everest,"This bed, which crops out starting about 70 m (230 ft) below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters."
Everest,"The bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m (23,000 and 28,200 ft), consists of the North Col Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between 8,200 to 8,600 m (26,900 to 28,200 ft)."
Everest,"The remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between 7,000 to 8,200 m (23,000 to 26,900 ft) on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble."
Everest,"Below 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest."
Everest,Mount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia.
Everest,Mount Everest is rising by about 2 mm per year.
Everest,"In respect of the recognition of the ""highest rocks on the planet"" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022."
Everest,"The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as ""a key place with geological elements and or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history."" There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest."
Everest,"A type of moss grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species."
Everest,"According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region."
Everest,"In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit."
Everest,Yaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs.
Everest,"From the Nepalese side, Everest is protected as part of Sagarmatha National Park, while from the Chinese side the mountain is protected as part of Qomolangma National Nature Reserve."
Everest,Mount Everest has an ice cap climate (K ppen EF) with all months averaging well below freezing.
Everest,"The base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers."
Everest,"As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari the director general of Nepal's tourism department said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude."
Everest,"The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011."
Everest,Mount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere.
Everest,Mount Everest hosts several weather stations that collect important data on high-altitude weather conditions.
Everest,"Set up by climate scientists Tom Matthews and Baker Perry in 2019, this station is positioned just below the summit of Everest, which is the highest point on Earth."
Everest,"Because Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts."
Everest,"Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s."
Everest,"Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it."
Everest,"In 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested climbing Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line."
Everest,"With Mallory leading, and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks, they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft)."
Everest,"In 1933, Lady Houston, a British millionaire, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit."
Everest,"In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has become the standard approach to Everest from the south."
Everest,The 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal.
Everest,"The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963 on the American Mount Everest expedition and on 22 May on the same expedition Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld were the first the traverse the mountain by climbing via the North Face and descending via the South Col."
Everest,Another element was an attempt to ski Everest.
Everest,"Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries."
Everest,"Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Everest in 2003 aged 70 and in 2013 aged 80."
Everest,"In 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit Everest."
Everest,The 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the Southwest Face from the Western Cwm.
Everest,"In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen."
Everest,"The Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander."
Everest,"In 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Everest on a difficult western ridge."
Everest,"These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and season, until the 16 deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest ice avalanche."
Everest,The guiding disaster gained publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Everest.
Everest,"The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by Matt Dickinson in his book The Other Side of Everest."
Everest,"Sixteen-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in, Within Reach: My Everest Story."
Everest,The 2015 feature film Everest is based on the events of this guiding disaster.
Everest,Much of this controversy was captured by the Discovery Channel while filming Everest: Beyond the Limit.
Everest,Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was unusually high at the time.
Everest,"However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp, shutting down the season."
Everest,"The avalanche began on Pumori, moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp."
Everest,"On 27 May, Kami Rita made his 21st summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people, along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit 21 times."
Everest,"There was an announcement of an expedition to re-measure the height of Everest, particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes."
Everest,"Although China has had permit restrictions, and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits, the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everest's extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll."
Everest,"In October 2025, blizzard-like conditions prompted Chinese authorities to evacuate nearly 350 people by October 6, with about 200 more stranded on the Everest Scenic Area."
Everest,"In 2017, a person who tried to climb Everest without the 11,000 permit was caught after he made it past the Khumbu icefall."
Everest,The number of permits issued each year by Nepal is: 2008: 160 2009: 220 2010: 209 2011: 225 2012: 208 2013: 316 2014: 326 (extended for use through 2019) 2015: 356 (extended for use through 2017) 2016: 289 2017: 366 to 373 2018: 346 2019: 381 2020: 0 (no permits issued during the pandemic) 2021: 408 (current record) The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest.
Everest,"They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest."
Everest,"In March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
Everest,"According to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with four years of climbing experience."
Everest,"Going with a ""celebrity guide"", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over 100,000 as of 2015."
Everest,"Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 in a country with high unemployment, but an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking."
Everest,"The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US 10,000 to US 30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team."
Everest,The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.
Everest,"These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous."
Everest,"For example, Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while ""Having people pay 65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all"", he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners: I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people."
Everest,"People climb Denali 6,190 m or 20,320 ft or Aconcagua 6,960 m or 22,834 ft and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that."" Speed climbing Altitude tents Some expedition teams have clients use altitude tents to pre-acclimatise prior to leaving for the mountain."
Everest,"Compared to traditional Everest expeditions that last 50 to 60 days, altitude tents can reduce the expedition time frame to 30 to 35 days."
Everest,Summiting with disabilities Summiting Everest with disabilities has become popular in the 21st century.
Everest,"Mount Everest has two main climbing routes, the Southeast Ridge from Nepal and the North Ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes."
Everest,"Southeast Ridge The ascent via the Southeast Ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal."
Everest,"When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time."
Everest,"North Ridge route The North Ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet."
Everest,"The summit of Everest has been described as ""the size of a dining room table""."
Everest,"(See the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit.) Below the summit, there is an area known as ""rainbow valley"", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear."
Everest,"At the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than 8,000 m or 26,000 ft), and face significant challenges to survival."
Everest,High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.
Everest,"The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0.333 standard atmospheres (337 mbar), resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe."
Everest,Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest.
Everest,"A 2008 study noted that the ""death zone"" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit."
Everest,"A 2014 article in The Atlantic about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes."
Everest,"Despite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period."
Everest,"Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and died in the death zone."
Everest,"Even for the able, Everest's Northeast Ridge is recognised as a challenge."
Everest,"Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk."
Everest,"While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen."
Everest,"One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes."
Everest,The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial.
Everest,"It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to 7,800 m (25,600 ft) at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres per hour (1,000 ft h)."
Everest,"...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function."
Everest,"He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest many bottles have accumulated on its slopes and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain."
Everest,"Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure."
Everest,"Although generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the ""post-monsoon season"")."
Everest,"For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years."
Everest,"Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the Los Angeles Times."
Everest,"By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest."
Everest,"In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed."
Everest,"In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed (2008): unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain."
Everest,"The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as ""out of control"" in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa."
Everest,"Felix Norton, and Howard Somervell 1952: First climb to South Col by 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition 1953: First ascent, by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on 1953 British Mount Everest expedition 1960: First reported ascent from the North Ridge by Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China."
Everest,"1975: First female ascent from the North Ridge, by Phanthog, deputy head of the second Chinese Everest expedition that sent nine climbers to the summit (27 May)."
Everest,"1988: First descent by paraglider, by Jean-Marc Boivin 1988: First female ascent without supplemental oxygen by Lydia Bradey 2000: First descent by ski by Davo Karni ar 2001: First ascent by a blind climber, Erik Weihenmayer 2001: Lhakpa Sherpa becomes first Nepali woman to summit Everest and survive."
Everest,"Lucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933."
Everest,"On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the Southeast Ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest, in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight."
Everest,"Boivin said: ""I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard."" In 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest."
Everest,Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called Ballooning Over Everest.
Everest,"Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the ""best snap on Earth"", according to UK newspaper The Telegraph."
Everest,"In May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest."
Everest,"Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier, with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI."
Everest,"On 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Babu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes."
Everest,"After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first people to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest."
Everest,"In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South Base Camp to Camp II to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit."
Everest,In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.
Everest,"That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as 6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest."
Everest,"Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping."
Everest,Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s.
Everest,Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.
Everest,"Other Everest skiers include Davo Karni ar of Slovenia, who completed a top to South Base Camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side, and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006."
Everest,In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest.
Everest,"Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the Southeast Ridge to a lower camp."
Everest,"In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) in 45 minutes."
Everest,"The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several ""hidden valleys"" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century ""lotus-born"" Buddhist saint."
Everest,"Near the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery, which has been called the ""sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world."" For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La."
Everest,"Miyolangsangma, a Tibetan Buddhist ""Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving"", is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest."
Everest,"According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation."
Everest,"The Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape."
Everest,"Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement."
Everest,"At approximately 5,500 m (18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there."
Everest,"In February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits."
Everest,"In April 2019, the Solukhumbu district's Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000 kg (20,000 lb) of garbage from Everest."

K2,"K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, at 8,611 metres (28,251 ft) above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest at 8,849 metres (29,032 ft)."
K2,"K2 became known as the Savage Mountain after George Bell a climber on the 1953 American expedition said, ""It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you."" Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 has long been the deadliest: prior to 2021, approximately one person had died on the mountain for every four who reached the summit."
K2,"After an increase in successful attempts, as of August 2023, an estimated 800 people have summited K2, with 96 deaths during attempted climbs."
K2,"K2 is nicknamed ""The King of Mountains"" and ""The Mountaineers' Mountain"", as well as ""The Mountain of Mountains"", a phrase popularized by Italian climber Reinhold Messner in his book on K2."
K2,"Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb."
K2,In January 2021 K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter by a team of Nepalese climbers led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.
K2,"K2's eastern face remains un-climbed, partly because of the hazards associated with the instability of its ice and snow formations."
K2,The name K2 is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India.
K2,"Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some 210 km (130 mi) to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labeling them K1 and K2, where the K stands for Karakoram."
K2,"K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name possibly due to its remoteness."
K2,"K2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured."
K2,"The surveyor's mark, K2, therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known."
K2,"The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for such a remote and challenging mountain."
K2,Andr Weil named K3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain K2.
K2,K2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range.
K2,"Melt waters from glaciers, such as those south and east of K2, feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply."
K2,"K2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature."
K2,"It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than 4,594 metres (15,072 ft), at the Kora La on the Nepal China border in the Mustang Lo."
K2,Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense.
K2,K2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height.
K2,"The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance."
K2,"A 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain on Earth."
K2,"A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works."
K2,"K2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8,611 metres (28,251 ft)."
K2,"In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named ""K2 60 Years Later"", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2."
K2,"The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02 metres (28,244.8 ft)."
K2,"The mountains of K2 and Broad Peak, and the area westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier, consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the K2 Gneiss and part of the Karakoram Metamorphic Complex."
K2,The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss.
K2,"On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes."
K2,"Near the memorial to the climbers who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the Gilkey-Puchoz sequence, are interbanded within the orthogneisses."
K2,"On the west face of Broad Peak and the south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss."
K2,The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults.
K2,"For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri."
K2,"40Ar 39Ar ages of 115 to 120 million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the K2 Gneiss demonstrate that it is an older, metamorphosed, pre-collisional Cretaceous granite."
K2,The granitic precursor (protolith) to the K2 Gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward-dipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of Asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust.
K2,"Later, the K2 Gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during post-Miocene time."
K2,The K2 Gneiss was exposed as the entire K2-Broad Peak-Gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace.
K2,"Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain ""K2"" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range."
K2,"The first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge."
K2,"The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather."
K2,"The next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around 6,250 metres (20,510 ft) on the South East Spur, now known as the Abruzzi Spur (or Abruzzi Ridge)."
K2,"After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within 150 metres (490 ft) of the summit before being driven back by a storm."
K2,"The next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition, led by Charles Houston, made a reconnaissance of the mountain."
K2,Charles Houston returned to K2 to lead the 1953 American expedition.
K2,The 1954 Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954.
K2,"The third ascent of K2 was in 1978, via a new route, the long and corniced Northeast Ridge."
K2,The first climber to reach the summit of K2 twice was Czech climber Josef Rakoncaj.
K2,The first woman to summit K2 was Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz on 23 June 1986.
K2,"On July 28, 2024, Japanese climber Naoko Watanabe became the first woman to summit K2 three times."
K2,"On 28 July 2024, Italian mountaineer Tommaso Lamantia summited K2 (8611m)."
K2,Thirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 K2 disaster.
K2,"Another six mountaineers died in the 1995 K2 disaster, while eleven climbers died in the 2008 K2 disaster."
K2,"2004 In 2004, the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Font n became the oldest person ever to summit K2, at the age of 65."

K2,"2011 On 23 August 2011, a team of four climbers reached the summit of K2 from the North side."
K2,"In the summer season, K2 saw a record crowd standing on its summit 28 climbers in a single day bringing the total for the year to 30."
K2,"2014 On 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2."
K2,"There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC."
K2,"Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions."
K2,"Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2."

K2,2002 2003 Netia K2 Polish Winter Expedition.
K2,Nine Russian climbers attempted K2's Abruzzi Spur route.
K2,"K2 features several routes, each with distinct characteristics; however, they all share common challenges."
K2,"At the summit of K2, only one-third of the oxygen present at sea level is available to climbers."
K2,"Because 75 of people who climb K2 use the Abruzzi Spur, these listed routes are rarely climbed."
K2,"In 2007, Denis Urubko and Serguey Samoilov intended to climb the K2's North Face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions."
K2,"For most of its climbing history, K2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen."

Denali,"In 1903, James Wickersham recorded the first attempt at climbing Denali, which was unsuccessful."
Denali,"The first verifiable ascent to Denali's summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum, who went by the South Summit."
Denali,"Denali is a granitic pluton, mostly pink quartz monzonite, lifted by tectonic pressure from the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate; at the same time, the sedimentary material above and around the mountain was stripped away by erosion."
Denali,The forces that lifted Denali also caused many deep earthquakes in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.
Denali,"The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the ""McKinley cluster""."
Denali,The high topography of Denali is related to the complex structural relationships created by the right-lateral Denali Fault and Denali Fault Bend.
Denali,The Denali Fault is caused by stresses created by the low-angle subduction of the Yakutat microplate underneath Alaska.
Denali,The Denali Fault Bend is characterized as a gentle restraining bend.
Denali,The Denali Fault Bend represents a curvature in the Denali Fault that is approximately 75 km long.
Denali,"As the right-lateral movement along the Denali Fault continues, high compressional forces created at the fault bend essentially push the crust up in a vertical fashion."
Denali,"Denali has a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190 m) above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above 19,685 feet (6,000 m) elevation in the world."

Denali,"The party received further navigational assistance at Anotoktilon, an Athabaskan hunting camp, where residents gave the group detailed directions to reach the glaciers at the foot of Denali."
Denali,"Aiming for the northwest buttress of Denali's north peak, they attempted to ascend directly; however, crevasses, ice fall and the lack of a clear passage caused them to turn and attempt to follow a spur via Jeffery Glacier where they believed they could see a way to the summit."
Denali,"Our only line of further ascent would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and that is impossible."" This wall, now known as the Wickersham Wall, juts 15,000 feet (4,572 m) upwards from the glacier to the north peak of Denali."
Denali,The party navigated up the Cook inlet and followed the path of the 1902 Brooks party towards Denali.
Denali,"In 1906, Cook initiated another expedition to Denali with co-leader Herschel Parker, a Columbia University professor of electrical engineering with extensive mountaineering experience."
Denali,"On April 3, 1910, Billy Taylor and Peter Anderson scrambled the final few hundred feet to reach the north peak of Denali, at 19,470 feet (5,934 m) high, the shorter of the two peaks."

Mount Kilimanjaro,"Multiple species are endemic to Mount Kilimanjaro, including the giant groundsel Dendrosenecio kilimanjari."
Mount Kilimanjaro,The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is disputed.
Mount Kilimanjaro,"Although the Chagga people of the Kilimanjaro Region have no name for the mountain, they call its two peaks Kipoo and Kimawenze."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"""Kilimanjaro"" may originate from the Chagga calling the mountain unclimbable kilemanjaare or kilemajyaro and explorers misinterpreting this as its name."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"In 1860, Johann Ludwig Krapf wrote that the Swahilis used the name Kilimanjaro and that it meant either ""mountain of greatness"" or ""mountain of caravans"", with a translation of njaro as greatness or jaro as ""caravans""."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"Kilimanjaro is a large dormant stratovolcano composed of three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, the highest; Mawenzi at 5,149 m (16,893 ft); and Shira, the lowest at 4,005 m (13,140 ft)."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"A map of the Kibo cone on Mount Kilimanjaro was published by the British government's Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS) in 1964 based on aerial photography conducted in 1962 as the ""Subset of Kilimanjaro, East Africa (Tanganyika) Series Y742, Sheet 56 2, D.O.S."
Mount Kilimanjaro,The volcanic interior of Kilimanjaro is poorly known because there has not been any significant erosion to expose the igneous strata that comprise the volcano's structure.
Mount Kilimanjaro,"Kibo's ice cap exists because Kilimanjaro is a little-dissected, massive mountain that rises above the snow line."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"A continuous ice cap covering approximately 400 km2 (150 sq mi) down to an elevation of 3,200 m (10,500 ft) covered Kilimanjaro during the Last Glacial Maximum in the Pleistocene epoch (the Main glacial episode), extending across the summits of Kibo and Mawenzi."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"Because of the exceptionally prolonged dry conditions during the subsequent Younger Dryas stadial, the ice fields on Kilimanjaro may have become extinct around 11,500 years BP."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"Ice cores taken from Kilimanjaro's Northern Ice Field (NIF) indicates that the glaciers there have a basal age of about 11,700 years, although an analysis of ice taken in 2011 from exposed vertical cliffs in the NIF supports an age extending only to 800 years BP."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"In contrast to the persistent slope glaciers, the glaciers on Kilimanjaro's crater plateau have appeared and disappeared repeatedly during the Holocene epoch, with each cycle lasting a few hundred years."

Mount Kilimanjaro,The Furtwangler Glacier on Kilimanjaro is a remnant of the ice cap that once covered the mountain.
Mount Kilimanjaro,"The glacier is named after Walter Furtwangler, who along with Ziegfried Koenig, was the fourth to ascend to the summit of Kilimanjaro in 1912."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"The forests of Kilimanjaro, far below the ice fields, ""are the essential water reservoirs for the local and regional populations""."

Mount Kilimanjaro,"The organization defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as 'a key place with geological elements and or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.' Kilimanjaro is attested to in numerous stories by the people who live in East Africa."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"Sailors' reports recorded by Ptolemy mention a ""moon mountain"" and a spring lake of the Nile, which may indicate Kilimanjaro, although available historical information does not allow differentiation among others in East Africa like Mount Kenya, the mountains of Ethiopia, the Virunga Mountains, the Rwenzori Mountains, and Kilimanjaro."
Mount Kilimanjaro,"According to English geographer Halford Mackinder and English explorer Harry Johnston, Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro."

Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn is a mountain of the Alps, straddling the main watershed and border between Switzerland and Italy."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn has four faces, each roughly oriented toward one of the four cardinal points."
Matterhorn,"Just east of the Matterhorn is Theodul Pass, the main passage between the two valleys on its north and south sides, which has been a trade route since the Roman era."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn was studied by Horace-B n dict de Saussure in the late 18th century; this was followed by other renowned naturalists and artists, such as John Ruskin, in the 19th century."
Matterhorn,"The first ascent of the Matterhorn was in 1865 from Zermatt by a party led by Edward Whymper, but during the descent, a sudden fall claimed the lives of four of the seven climbers."
Matterhorn,"The west face, the highest of the Matterhorn's four faces, was completely climbed only in 1962."
Matterhorn,"It is estimated that over 500 alpinists have died on the Matterhorn, making it one of the deadliest peaks in the world."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn is mainly composed of gneisses (originally fragments of the African plate before the Alpine orogeny) from the Dent Blanche nappe, lying over ophiolites and sedimentary rocks of the Penninic nappes."
Matterhorn,"The mountain's current shape is the result of cirque erosion due to multiple glaciers diverging from the peak, such as the Matterhorn Glacier at the base of the north face."
Matterhorn,"Each year, numerous mountaineers try to climb the Matterhorn from the H rnli Hut via the northeast H rnli ridge, the most popular route to the summit."
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn has been part of the Swiss Federal Inventory of Natural Monuments since 1983.
Matterhorn,"The name Matterhorn derives from the German words Matte (""meadow"") and Horn (""horn""), and is often translated as ""the peak of the meadows""."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn is also named Gran B cca (""big mountain"") by the Vald tains and Horu by the local Walliser German speaking people."
Matterhorn,"The German name ""Matterhorn"" first appears in the year 1682."
Matterhorn,"Because of its recognizable shape, many other similar mountains around the world were named or nicknamed ""the Matterhorn of"" their respective countries or mountain ranges."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn has two distinct summits, situated at either end of a 100-metre-long (330 ft) exposed rocky crest which forms the Italian Swiss border."
Matterhorn,"In August 1792, the Genevan geologist and explorer Horace B n dict de Saussure made the first measurement of the Matterhorn's height, using a sextant and a 50-foot-long (15 m) chain spread out on the Theodul glacier."
Matterhorn,"The topographic prominence of the Matterhorn is 1,042 metres (3,419 ft) as the ridge connecting it with a higher summit (in this case the Weisshorn, which is the culminating point of the range west of the Mattertal valley) sinks to a height of 3,436 m (11,273 ft) at the Col Durand, a saddle between the Pointe de Zinal and the Mont Durand."
Matterhorn,"Considering mountains with a topographic prominence of at least 300 m (980 ft), the Matterhorn is the sixth-highest summit in the Alps and Europe outside the Caucasus Mountains."
Matterhorn,"On the official International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation list of Alpine four-thousanders, which also includes subsidiary summits of higher mountains such as the nearby Monte Rosa, the Matterhorn is the 12th highest summit in the Alps."
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn has a pyramidal shape with four faces nearly facing the four compass points.
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn does not form a perfect square pyramid, as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn's faces are steep, and only small patches of snow and ice cling to them; regular avalanches send the snow down to accumulate on the glaciers at the base of each face, the largest of which are the Tiefmattengletscher to the west, part of the Zmutt Glacier, and the Matterhorn Glacier to the north."
Matterhorn,Smaller glaciers lie at the base of the south face (the Lower Matterhorn Glacier) and the east face (unnamed).
Matterhorn,"The Theodul Pass, located on the watershed between the Matterhorn and the Breithorn, at 3,295 metres, is the easiest passage between the two valleys and countries (the slightly lower Furggjoch not being used as a pass)."
Matterhorn,"To its west lies the Zmutt ridge (Zmuttgrat), between the north and west faces and aligned towards the Wandfluehorn; this is, according to Collomb, ""the classic route up the mountain, its longest ridge, also the most disjointed."" The Lion ridge (Cresta del Leone Ar te du lion), lying between the south and west faces and aligned towards the Dent d'H rens is the Italian normal route and goes across Pic Tyndall; Collomb comments, ""A superb rock ridge, the shortest on the mountain, now draped with many fixed ropes, but a far superior climb compared with the H rnli."" Finally the south side is separated from the east side by the Furggen ridge (Furggengrat), which is aligned towards the Klein Matterhorn."
Matterhorn,"While the Matterhorn is the culminating point of the Valtournenche on the south, it is only one of the many 4000 metres summits of the Mattertal valley on the north."
Matterhorn,"This section of the Pennine Alps, including the Matterhorn, the Zinalrothorn, the Dent Blanche, the Dent d'H rens, the Breithorn, the Strahlhorn, the Rimpfischhorn and the Alphubel, concentrates most of western Europe's highest mountains and forms a crown of peaks around Zermatt."
Matterhorn,The deeply glaciated region between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa (named Dent Blanche-Matterhorn-Monte Rosa) is listed in the Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments since 1983.
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn is an isolated mountain.
Matterhorn,"Because of its position on the main Alpine watershed and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn's pyramid is composed of Paleozoic rocks, which were thrust over the Matterhorn's Mesozoic base during the Cenozoic."
Matterhorn,"Apart from the base of the mountain, the Matterhorn is composed of gneiss belonging to the Dent Blanche klippe, an isolated part of the Austroalpine nappes, lying over the Penninic nappes."
Matterhorn,"For this reason, the Matterhorn has been popularized as an African mountain."
Matterhorn,"The Swiss explorer and geologist Horace-B n dict de Saussure, inspired by the view of the Matterhorn, anticipated modern theories of geology: What power must have been required to shatter and to sweep away the missing parts of this pyramid; for we do not see it surrounded by heaps of fragments; one only sees other peaks - themselves rooted to the ground - whose sides, equally rent, indicate an immense mass of d bris, of which we do not see any trace in the neighbourhood."
Matterhorn,The formation of the Matterhorn (and the whole Alpine range) started with the break-up of the Pangaea continent 200 million years ago into Laurasia (containing Europe) and Gondwana (containing Africa).
Matterhorn,"While the rocks constituting the nearby Monte Rosa remained in Laurasia, the rocks constituting the Matterhorn found themselves in Gondwana, separated by the newly formed Tethys Ocean."
Matterhorn,The subduction of the oceanic crust left traces still visible today at the base of the Matterhorn (accretionary prism).
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn acquired its characteristic pyramidal shape in much more recent times as it was caused by natural erosion over the past million years.
Matterhorn,"At the beginning of alpine orogeny, the Matterhorn was only a rounded mountain like a hill."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn remained relatively little known until 1865, but the successful ascent followed by the tragic accident of the expedition led by Edward Whymper caused a rush on the mountains surrounding Zermatt."
Matterhorn,"In 2023 the Matterhorn Alpine Crossing opened via Klein Matterhorn and Testa Grigia, thus connecting the two towns."
Matterhorn,"Areas served by cable car are the Unterrothorn and the Klein Matterhorn (Little Matterhorn) (3,883 m, highest transportation system in Europe)."
Matterhorn,"In 2023, a cable car link between Testa Grigia (or T te grise) and the Klein Matterhorn opened."
Matterhorn,It finally provided a direct link between the Swiss and Italian sides of the Matterhorn.
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn Museum (Zermatt) relates the general history of the region from alpinism to tourism.
Matterhorn,"In the museum, which is in the form of a reconstituted mountain village, the visitors can relive the first and tragic ascent of the Matterhorn and see the objects that belonged to the protagonists."
Matterhorn,The Tour of the Matterhorn can be effected by trekkers in about 10 days.
Matterhorn,An average of around twelve people per year have died on Matterhorn in the ten years from 2005 to 2015.
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn was one of the last of the main Alpine mountains to be ascended, not because of its technical difficulty, but because of the fear it inspired in early mountaineers."
Matterhorn,"Bennen to Matterhorn's Shoulder at 4,248 m (13,937 ft), which was subsequently named Pic Tyndall in honor of the client."
Matterhorn,"Upon descent, Hadow, Croz, Hudson and Douglas fell to their deaths on the Matterhorn Glacier, and all but Douglas (whose body was never found) are buried in the Zermatt churchyard."
Matterhorn,"In the summer of 1860, Edward Whymper came across the Matterhorn for the first time."
Matterhorn,"Although the unclimbed Matterhorn had a mixed reputation among British mountaineers, it fascinated Whymper."
Matterhorn,"The Carrels decided to give Matterhorn a try by themselves again, and caught up with Whymper at nightfall."
Matterhorn,"Whymper now had ""a strong inclination to engage the pair; but, finally, decided against it"" and the Carrels went alone to reach a new high on Matterhorn of 4,032 m (13,228 ft) the next day."
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn remained unclimbed.
Matterhorn,"In the decisive year 1865, Whymper returned with new plans, deciding to attack the Matterhorn via its south face instead of the Italian ridge."
Matterhorn,"Meanwhile, the Italian Alpine Club was founded and its leaders, Felice Giordano and Quintino Sella, established plans to conquer the Matterhorn before any non-Italian could succeed."
Matterhorn,"He feared the arrival of Whymper, now a rival, and wrote to Quintino Sella: I have tried to keep everything secret, but that fellow whose life seems to depend on the Matterhorn is here, suspiciously prying into everything."
Matterhorn,"He encountered Lord Francis Douglas, a Scottish mountaineer, who also wanted to climb the Matterhorn."
Matterhorn,"the world was at our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered."
Matterhorn,"The bodies of Croz, Hadow and Hudson were found on the Matterhorn Glacier, but the body of Douglas was never found."
Matterhorn,"Am Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: ""At last we crossed the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!"" On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall's flagstaff."
Matterhorn,"Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn."" On 22 August 1871, while wearing a white print dress, Lucy Walker became the first woman to reach the summit of the Matterhorn, followed a few weeks later by her rival Meta Brevoort."
Matterhorn,The last of the Matterhorn's four ridges to be ascended was the Furggen (south-east) ridge.
Matterhorn,"In 1966, Ren Arnold and Joseph Graven made the first solo enchainement of the four Matterhorn ridges in 19.5 hours."
Matterhorn,"After crossing the Matterhorn Glacier at the base of the north face, they ascended the Zmutt Ridge and then descended the Italian (Lion) Ridge to the village of Breuil."
Matterhorn,"On 20 August 1992, Italian alpinist Hans Kammerlander and Swiss alpine guide Diego Wellig climbed the Matterhorn four times in just 23 hours and 26 minutes."
Matterhorn,"In 1995, Bruno Brunod climbed Matterhorn from the village Breuil-Cervinia in 2 h 10 min."
Matterhorn,"and from Breuil-Cervinia to Matterhorn and back, in 3:14:44 On 21 August 2013, the Spanish mountain runner Kilian Jornet broke Brunod's record as it took him 1 hour, 56 min to the top from Breuil-Cervinia - a round-trip time of 2 hours 52 minutes to return to his starting point."
Matterhorn,"Faces William Penhall and guides made the first (partial) ascent of the west face, the Matterhorn's most hidden and unknown, one hour after Mummery and party's first ascent of the Zmutt ridge on 3 September 1879."
Matterhorn,Ueli Steck set the record time in climbing the north face (Schmid route) of Matterhorn in 2009 with a time of 1 hour 56 minutes.
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn is thus amongst the deadliest mountains in the world.
Matterhorn,Here is a list of people who died on the mountain whose bodies were not recovered until later: 1954 French skier Henri le Masne went missing on the Matterhorn.
Matterhorn,"In 2005 remains were found, identified as le Masne in 2018 1970 Two Japanese climbers missing; remains found after 45 years in 2015 1979 British climber missing; remains found after 34 years in 2014 2014 Japanese hiker missing; remains found 2018 2016 Two British climbers missing; remains found 2016 The first ascent of the Matterhorn changed mountain culture."
Matterhorn,"Today, all ridges and faces of the Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons, and mountain guides take a large number of people up the northeast H rnli route each summer."
Matterhorn,"In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during summer."
Matterhorn,"Aegidius Tschudi, one of the earliest Alpine topographers and historians, was the first to mention the region around the Matterhorn in his work, De Prisca ac Vera Alpina Raethi, published in Basel in 1538."
Matterhorn,He approached the Matterhorn as a student when in his Alpine travels he reached the summit of the Theodul Pass but he does not seem to have paid any particular attention to the mountain itself.
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn remained unstudied for more than two centuries, until a geologist from Geneva, Horace Benedict de Saussure, travelled to the mountain, which filled him with admiration."
Matterhorn,"""Its precipitous sides,"" he wrote, ""which give no hold to the very snows, are such as to afford no means of access."" Yet his scientific interest was kindled by ""the proud peak which rises to so vast an altitude, like a triangular obelisk, that seems to be carved by a chisel."" His mind intuitively grasped the causes which gave the peak its present precipitous form: the Matterhorn was not like a perfected crystal; the centuries had laboured to destroy a great part of an ancient and much larger mountain."
Matterhorn,"On his first journey de Saussure had come from Ayas to the Col des Cimes Blanches, from where the Matterhorn first comes into view; descending to Breuil, he ascended to the Theodul Pass."
Matterhorn,"On his second journey, in 1792, he came to the Valtournanche, studying and describing it; he ascended to the Theodul Pass, where he spent three days, analysing the structure of the Matterhorn, whose height he was the first to measure, and collecting stones, plants and insects."
Matterhorn,"During these days he climbed the Klein Matterhorn (3,883 metres), which he named the Cime Brune du Breithorn."
Matterhorn,The first inquirers began to come to the Matterhorn.
Matterhorn,The Matterhorn was to them an object of the most intense and continuous admiration.
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn is mentioned in a guide-book to Switzerland by Johann Gottfried Ebel, which was published in Z rich towards the end of the eighteenth century, and translated into English in 1818."
Matterhorn,"The mountain appeared in it under the three names of Silvius, Matterhorn, and Mont Cervin, and was briefly described as one of the most splendid and wonderful obelisks in the Alps."
Matterhorn,"Couttet of Chamonix, the same man who had gone with de Saussure to the top of the Klein Matterhorn in 1792."
Matterhorn,The writings of these pioneers make much mention of the Matterhorn; the bare and inert rock is gradually quickened into life by men's enthusiasm.
Matterhorn,"""Stronger minds,"" remarked Edward Whymper, ""felt the influence of the wonderful form, and men who ordinarily spoke or wrote like rational beings, when they came under its power seemed to quit their senses, and ranted and rhapsodised, losing for a time all common forms of speech."" Among the poets of the Matterhorn during these years (1834 to 1840) were Elie de Beaumont, a famous French geologist; Pierre Jean douard Desor, a naturalist of Neuch tel, who went up there with a party of friends, two of whom were Louis Agassiz and Bernhard Studer."
Matterhorn,"In 1841 James David Forbes, professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, came to see the Matterhorn."
Matterhorn,"He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable."
Matterhorn,"These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how at a time when the idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream."
Matterhorn,"Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise."
Matterhorn,"Rodolphe T pffer, who first accompanied and guided youth to the Alps for purposes of education and amusement, began his journeys in 1832, but it is only in 1840 that he mentions the Matterhorn."
Matterhorn,"He has described this journey of his in a chapter entitled Voyage autour du Mont Blanc jusqu' Zermatt, here he sings a hymn of praise to the Matterhorn, comparing its form with a ""huge crystal of a hundred facets, flashing varied hues, that softly reflects the light, unshaded, from the uttermost depths of the heavens""."
Matterhorn,"T pffer's book was illustrated by Alexandre Calame, his master and friend, with drawings of the Matterhorn, executed in the romantic style of the period."
Matterhorn,"About this time there came a man who studied the Matterhorn in its structure and form, and who sketched it and described it in all its parts with the curiosity of the artist and the insight of the scientist."
Matterhorn,Ruskin was the Matterhorn's poet par excellence.
Matterhorn,"He went to Zermatt in 1844, and it is to be noticed as a curious fact, that the first time he saw the Matterhorn it did not please him."
Matterhorn,"In the preface to the first volume of the Alpine Journal, which appeared in 1863, the editor Hereford Brooke George wrote that: ""While even if all other objects of interest in Switzerland should be exhausted, the Matterhorn remains (who shall say for how long?) unconquered and apparently invincible."" Whymper successfully reached the summit in 1865, but four men perished on the descent."
Matterhorn,"In 1890 the Federal Government was asked simultaneously by the same contractor for a concession for the Zermatt-Gornergrat railway, and for a Zermatt-Matterhorn one."
Matterhorn,The latter declared the Matterhorn a natural wonder worthy of protection and refused the concession to the engineer.
Matterhorn,"Hundreds of other mountains have been compared to the Matterhorn, either for their resemblance to it or because of their apparent inaccessibility."
Matterhorn,"Little Matterhorn (1,480 m), Australia Matterhorn (1,600 m), in Antarctica Matterhorn (3,305 m), in Nevada Matterhorn Peak (3,744 m), in California Matterhorn Peak (4,144 m), in Colorado Matterhorn Peak (2,636 m), in British Columbia Neny Matterhorn (1,125 m), Antarctica During the 20th century, the Matterhorn and the story of the first ascent in particular, inspired various artists and film producers such as Luis Trenker and Walt Disney."
Matterhorn,"In 2021, a Matterhorn-related attraction opened in the Swiss Museum of Transport, enabling visitors to climb it virtually from the Solvay Hut to the summit."
Matterhorn,"Designed in 1908 by Emil Cardinaux, a leading poster artist of the time, the Matterhorn poster for the Zermatt tourist office is often considered the first modern poster."
Matterhorn,Another affiche depicting the Matterhorn was created by Cardinaux for the chocolate brand Toblerone in the 1920s.
Matterhorn,The image of the Matterhorn first appeared on Toblerone chocolate bars in 1960.
Matterhorn,"Since then, the Matterhorn has become a reference that still inspires graphic artists today and has been used extensively for all sort of publicity and advertising."
Matterhorn,"The Matterhorn (1849), John Ruskin The Matterhorn (1867), Albert Bierstadt Matterhorn (1879), Edward Theodore Compton Le Cervin (1892), F lix Vallotton The Matterhorn is depicted in the background of the cover for Depeche Mode's third album Construction Time Again (1983), that reached the Top Ten of the album charts in the UK and Germany."
